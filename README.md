## Requirements

* Java 7 or higher.

## How to compile

First delete the content from the bin folder.
Once the bin folder is empty, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
javac src/br/ufu/facom/minas/core/datastructure/*.java src/br/ufu/facom/minas/core/decisionrule/*/*.java src/br/ufu/facom/minas/core/decisionrule/*.java src/br/ufu/facom/minas/core/clustering/*.java src/br/ufu/facom/minas/core/*.java src/br/ufu/facom/minas/example/*.java -d bin
```

## How to run

To run the MOA3 example, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
java -cp bin br.ufu.facom.minas.example.MOA3
```
To run the SynEDC example, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
java -cp bin br.ufu.facom.minas.example.SynEDC
```
To run the SynD example, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
java -cp bin br.ufu.facom.minas.example.SynD
```
To run the KDD99 example, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
java -cp bin br.ufu.facom.minas.example.KDD99
```
To run the covtype example, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```
java -cp bin br.ufu.facom.minas.example.covtype
```

## How to generate the javadocs

Execute the following command from the root of the project:
```
javadoc -sourcepath src -d docs -subpackages .
```
